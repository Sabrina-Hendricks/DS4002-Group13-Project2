## Reproduction Information 
1. **Data Gathering**: We got out data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the U.S. Department of Commerce - [National Data - National Income and Product Accounts] (https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=19&step=2&isuri=1&categories=survey&_gl=1*1hz95g3*_ga*OTA0NjM2ODc4LjE3MjgzMTU5MTg.*_ga_J4698JNNFT*MTcyODMxNTkxOC4xLjEuMTcyODMxNjAwMC42MC4wLjA.#eyJhcHBpZCI6MTksInN0ZXBzIjpbMSwyLDMsM10sImRhdGEiOltbImNhdGVnb3JpZXMiLCJTdXJ2ZXkiXSxbIk5JUEFfVGFibGVfTGlzdCIsIjcwIl0sWyJGaXJzdF9ZZWFyIiwiMjAyMCJdLFsiTGFzdF9ZZWFyIiwiMjAyNCJdLFsiU2NhbGUiLCItOSJdLFsiU2VyaWVzIiwiUSJdXX0=). We selected the Healthcare section of the database manually in Numbers - this selection is uploaded in Github as our original file under the _Data Folder_. The scripts include fetching the data from our Github repo.
2. **Data Cleaning**: To reproduce our cleaned dataset, run the `Project2MI3_Cleaning.ipynb` script. We downloaded the final dataframe and uploaded it to Github. The future scripts will fetch the cleaned dataset from the _Data Folder_.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: To explore the data and gather initial insights to refine the analysis plan, run the `Project2MI2EDA.ipynb` script under the _Scripts Folder_.
4. **Analysis**: To conduct analysis on the data, there are is one main file to run: `MI3_TrendAnalysis.ipynb` You can find it in the _Scripts Folder_.
